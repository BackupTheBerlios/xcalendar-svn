You can install XCalendar on Delphi versions 5 and above.
No pre-built package is available. you should create a package for
yourself. For those who don't want to follow the nonsensical
instructions, please make sure you do step 4.

Before installing, you might want to take a look at the "Res"
folder and run "mk.bat" from your desired language folder to
change the default calendar settings. The resources in "Fa-IR" have
been installed by default.
