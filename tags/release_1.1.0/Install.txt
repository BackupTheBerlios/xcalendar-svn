You can install XCalendar on Delphi versions 5 and above.
If you have another version of XCalendar installed, you should
remove it before installing the new one. (Use "Component"->
"Install Packages..." dialog box)

Before installing, you might want to take a look at the "Res"
folder and run "mk.bat" from your desired language folder to
change the default calendar settings. The resources in "Fa-IR"
have been installed by default.
